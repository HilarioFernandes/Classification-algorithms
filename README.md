# Classification algorithms

This repository contains implementations (in R) of some of the basic classification algorithms: classification trees, random florests, bagging, boosting and support vector machines.

*Auxiliary_functions.R* contains useful functions.

*Simulations.R* includes the code that generates the simulated data to be later analyzed. The main file from this section, *Results.csv*, is already included in the repository, so the simulations don't need to be done again.

*Analyses.R* contains the tables and plots derived from the data in *Results.csv*. Some topics considered, among others, were:

- Execution time for each method;

- Sample size's influence on performance;

- Dimensionality's influence on performance.

*Plots.R* generates a few plots that illustrate the classifiers under consideration.
